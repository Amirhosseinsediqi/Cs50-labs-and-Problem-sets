Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and performing browser automation. It is functional for all browsers, works on all major OS and its scripts are written in various languages i.e Python, Java, C#, etc, we will be working with Python
And the reason for its popularity:Why is selenium so popular?
Image result
Selenium has a large and active user community that offers comprehensive support. This makes the tool highly resourceful and cost-effective. Irrespective of numerous tools on the market, Selenium was still considered as the first choice for many testing projects
And why we used it:We control web browsers through applications and do browser automation. It is applicable to all browsers, works on all major operating systems, and its scripts are written in different languages   such as Python, Java, C #, etc.

pyttsx3 What does this library do? : pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. ... it is a very easy to use tool which converts the entered text into speech. The pyttsx3 module supports two voices first is female and the second is male which is provided by “sapi5” for windows and Engine instance. During construction, the engine initializes a pyttsx3. driver. ... drivers module. After construction, an application uses the engine object to register and unregister event callbacks; produce and stop speech; get and set speech engine properties; and start and stop event loops..
and this pyttsx3 is safe because
The python package easy-pyttsx3 was scanned for known vulnerabilities and missing license, and no issues were found. Thus the package was deemed as safe to use.
why we used it: What is the use of pyttsx3?
pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. An application invokes the pyttsx3

requestes: Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python. ... Requests will allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests using Python. With it, you can add content like headers, form data, multipart files, and parameters via simple Python libraries. It also allows you to access the response data of Python in the same way.
What is requests get in Python?When the method is GET, all form data is encoded into the URL, appended to the action URL as query string parameters. With POST, form data appears within the message body of the HTTP request. In GET method, the parameter data is limited to what we can stuff into the request line (URL).
How does request work in Python? Python requests module has several built-in methods to make Http requests to specified URI using GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or HEAD requests. A Http request is meant to either retrieve data from a specified URI or to push data to a server. It works as a request-response protocol between a client and a server.
How do I install module requests? You should always work in a virtual environment to prevent conflicts. You can use pip to install a specific version of the Requests module into a Virtualenv environment for Python 2 or Venv for Python 3 projects. venv will create a virtual Python installation in the <env_name> folder. and go to the search windows and write cmd and click on command pront and then write pip install requests.
if you dont know what is it pip read the text :How do you use pip?

You use pip with an install command followed by the name of the package you want to install. pip looks for the package in PyPI, calculates its dependencies, and installs them to ensure requests will work. Notice that you use python -m to update pip . The -m switch tells Python to run a module as an executable.
How do I install Anaconda requests? 2 Answers
To install libraries in an Anaconda environment, you should do conda install <library_name>
To install the requests library, it would be conda install requests.

Capturing video using OpenCV

OpenCV has a function to read video, which is cv2. VideoCapture(). We can access our webcam using pass 0 in the function parameter. If you want to capture CCTV footage then we can pass RTSP url in the function parameter, which is really useful for video analysis.
What is cv2 Python? OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. cv2. imread() method loads an image from the specified file.
Is OpenCV easy to learn? The truth is that learning OpenCV used to be quite challenging. The documentation was hard to navigate. The tutorials were hard to follow and incomplete. And even some of the books were a bit tedious to work through.
